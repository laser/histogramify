A proposed sequence, using the text from _The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket_ by Poe:

http://xroads.virginia.edu/%7EMA98/silverman/poe/fulltext.html

- Write a program which reads text from stdin and (single threaded) writes (to stdout) a histogram of word frequencies (omitting punctuation).
- Modify the program to divide the work amongst worker threads who write their results to an in-memory data structure (owned by the parent) which is wrapped in a mutex. When work is complete, parent outputs histogram to stdout.
- Modify the program to divide the work amongst worker threads who write their results to a channel consumed by the parent thread. When work is complete, the parent outputs histogram to stdout.

Example histogram behavior:

```
$ cat words.txt

foo
foo foo foo foo
bar
bar
bar
baz
baz baz baz
baz
baz baz

$ cat words | histogramify

===== 5 foo
=== 3 bar
========= 7 baz
```
